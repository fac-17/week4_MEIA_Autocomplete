## Autocomplete App

### Project Description
A simple autocomplete widget that accepts a search input and shows an auto-updating list of completed inputs

As a user visiting this site, I should be able to
- [ ]Type in a query into a search input
- [ ]See a list of suggested queries that start with the text I entered
- [ ]See an **updated list** of suggestions each time I input a new character into the search field
- [ ]Have results that ignore any special characters and still give me suggestions based on the letters in my search field
